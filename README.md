   RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
   SOFTWARE_SUMMARY=Brief description of your software
   GET_ITEM_SUMMARY=True
   GET_CHANGELOG_SUMMARY=True
   PROJECT_URL=https://dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project
   QUERY=YourQueryID
   ACCESS_TOKEN=YourAzureDevOpsPAT
   GPT_API_KEY=YourOpenAIApiKey
   MODEL_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
   MODEL=gpt-4
   OUTPUT_FOLDER=Releases
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   ```

### Usage

#### Running Locally

To generate release notes, you can run the tool locally:

```bash
python -m changelog_weaver
```

This will fetch work items based on the configuration and generate a Markdown file containing the release notes.

#### Integrating with CI/CD

You can integrate Changelog Weaver into your CI/CD pipeline using the provided Azure DevOps YAML configuration or a GitHub Actions workflow:

- **Azure DevOps**: Copy the `Auto-Release-Notes.yaml` from the `pipelines/` directory to your projectâ€™s pipeline configuration.
- **GitHub Actions**: Adjust the provided GitHub Actions YAML to suit your repository setup.

### Customization

Changelog Weaver is highly customizable. You can modify the GPT prompts in `changelog_weaver/configuration/prompts.py` to change how the release notes are generated. Additionally, the output format and details can be adjusted in `changelog_weaver/configuration/output.py`.
